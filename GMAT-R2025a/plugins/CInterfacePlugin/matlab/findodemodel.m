% FINDODEMODEL GMAT force model accessor
%  findodemodel(modelname) Locates a GMAT ODE model and sets it at the 
%  model for use in subsequent calls.
%
%   INPUTS
%   VARIABLE        SIZE    	DESCRIPTION (Optional/Default)
%   modelname       (1x1)       (Optional) Name of the desired ODE model. 
%                               If omitted, the first ODE model found is 
%                               selected.
%
%   OUTPUTS
%   retval          (1x1)       The ID for the ODE Model.
